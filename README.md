# Job Listing Application (Nuxt 3 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS)

This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic job listing application. Users can view available jobs, search for jobs by title or company, filter jobs by location or remote availability, and paginate through results. It uses Nuxt 3 with Vue 3's Composition API, TypeScript, Pinia for state management, and Axios for API requests.

## Features

- **View Job Listings**: Fetch and display job listings with details such as title, company, and location.
- **Search Jobs**: Users can search for jobs by company name or job title.
- **Filter Jobs**: Filter job listings based on location, or toggle a checkbox to view only remote jobs.
- **Load More**: Paginate through the list of jobs with a "Load More" button to fetch additional job data.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop using TailwindCSS.
